# Unhandled Division by Zero Error in Node.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: unhandled division by zero.  The `bug.js` file contains a function that does not correctly handle cases where the denominator is zero, resulting in a runtime error. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to fix the issue using appropriate error handling techniques.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`. This will produce a division by zero error.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.
